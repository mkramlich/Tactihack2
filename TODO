persisting/reloading a game session to disk (pickle or sqlite3)

make the server able to serve multiple distinct game sessions from a single server process (running instance of tactihackd)
    the clients need to specify which game session they're talking about

option when starting the pygame client where it also starts up a server to talk to 

can switch weapons from among your inventory (costs AP)

can reload your gun from spare clips/ammo in your inventory (costs AP)

can drop items

can pickup item from ground (like an ammo clip there) (costs AP)

is finite limit to qty/mass of items you can pickup/carry

can be ammo on ground, can be picked up to add to your ammo

can be wearing armor, if shot, reduces damage, varies by armor type/amount

can throw a knife/dagger/shuriken if it's wielded, or do with off-hand without losing your main weapon wield status

if tree is between shooter and target, chance of hitting is reduced

guy can man a machine gun, when fires, it does way more damage per bullet and more bullets per tick/AP

is key to 'end turn' which cycles turn to other faction; at a faction's turn start all his guy's AP is reset to max

each faction is named; guys/things can belong/controlled-by a faction

all units of same faction have same color on map

can throw a grenade

can make a melee attack, must be adjacent

during a computer-controlled faction's turn, they do things via AI; if a badguy soldier is killed/shot, it effects the morale of his AI teammates

option to show each guy's AP-left on map next to him

victory condition check

can set off a tripwire which then activates an alarm; the player can see and "hear" the alarm blaring

hidden mines

factions: Eagle (blue) and SNAKE (red); non-com civilians are white; unknown persons yellow

in pygame client, delete old 'fbs' entries so doesn't leak

in pygame client, key to see all msgs

in pygame client, key to show a tabular report on your field team

visibility, LOS

range of effectiveness (to hit and dmg) dropoffs for weapons by weapon type
