Tactihack Pygame

2013 Sep 22

This is a stab at re-writing/re-inventing TactiHack, from scratch, using PyGame. We'll start by implementing the core gameplay, the core fun part of movement and combat and exploration of a map, and won't add campaigns/scenarios/recruiting/etc until much much later in the project life. Another goal is to give it a client/server architecture from the start; and to use ZeroMQ somewhat as an excuse to gain more experience using it; another goal is we're going to publish the source to this in my public GitHub account as a career feather-in-cap

This uses zeromq 3.2.4 for the client/server communication

TAB to cycle selected unit
t to cycle current fire target
f to make selected unit fire at current target 
vi/Rogue-like keys to move selected unit in that direction (hjkl yu bn)
q to quit

some units cannot fire, some cannot move
the selected unit must have AP left to move or fire
ammo is required to fire
